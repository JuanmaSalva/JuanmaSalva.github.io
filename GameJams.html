						</header>

						<p> As of today, I have taken part in three game jams.</p>

						<h3>Programa Animalista de Chillar muy Alto</h3>

						<p> <i>Programa Animalista de Chillar muy Alto</i> is a game fully controlled by voice in which the player needs
							to guide a taxi driver through a city by interpreting the signs alongside the roads and yelling the directions
							to the driver.
						</p>

						<p> The game was developed in Unity during a week by a group of eight people for the JamOn game jam. This was my first experience on a 
							game jam and it actually didn't go that bad. We didn't win any prizes but we got a mention for the most
							diversifiers used.
						</p>

						<p> The game can be downloaded on out <a href="https://tai1games.itch.io/pacma">itch.io</a>, and the code is public in 
							our <a href="https://github.com/Tai1Games/PACMA">GitHub</a></p>

						
						<h3>Primates Perfectos</h3>

						<p> <i>Primates Perfectos</i> is a comical game about NFT's and making a living out of them. The player needs to create,
							mint and sell NFT's to make a profit. But they need to be careful! if they don't follow the trends, they will
							end up broke. </p>

						<p> This was a weekend long jam developed by five people for the ComJamOn jam. The game was made in unity and we won
							the second prize.
						</p>
						
						<p> The game can be downloaded on out <a href="https://tai1games.itch.io/primatesperfectos">itch.io</a>.</p>
				


						<h3>Super Ultra Meha Azme Reir</h3>
						
						<img src="images/GameJams/SUMAR.png" width="30%"/>

						<p> <i>Super Ultra Meha Azme Reir</i> is a multiplayer game where two clowns compete to be the funniest of them all.
							Each player has to try to keep the maximum number of balls in the air while juggling but beware, the enemy can 
							throw their balls at you making you lose time.  </p>

						<p> This was a weekend long jam developed by five people in Unity for the 2024 Global Game Jam.</p>

						<p> The game can be downloaded on out <a href="https://jbopp.itch.io/super-ultra-mega-azme-rer">itch.io</a>.</p>
